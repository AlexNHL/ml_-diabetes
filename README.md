## Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning Models and SMOTE

* Determined the best indicators for predicting whether a patient has diabetes and generated insights into each of these risk factors
* Addressed the accuracy paradox caused by an imbalanced dataset by adopting the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
* Applied machine learning models to classify diabetes, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
* Conducted error analysis to compare the performance of different models
